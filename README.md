## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) [Specify version, e.g., 17 or higher]**
* **[Your Database e.g., MySQL Server, PostgreSQL]**
* **[Maven or Gradle, depending on your build tool]**
* **[Any other specific tools or dependencies, e.g., Node.js if you have a separate frontend]**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pavannagula25/E-commerce-Website.git](https://github.com/pavannagula25/E-commerce-Website.git)
    cd E-commerce-Website
    ```
2.  **Build the project:**
    * If using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    * If using Gradle:
        ```bash
        gradle build
        ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Create a database:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE [your_database_name];
    ```
2.  **Update application properties:**
    Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) and update the database connection details:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/[your_database_name]?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
    spring.datasource.username=[your_db_username]
    spring.datasource.password=[your_db_password]
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create/none depending on your setup
    # Add other database-specific properties if needed
    ```
    **Note:** For production environments, avoid `ddl-auto=create` or `update` as it can lead to data loss.

### Running the Application

1.  **Run from your IDE:**
    Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), locate the main application class (e.g., `ECommerceWebsiteApplication.java`), and run it.
2.  **Run from command line:**
    * If using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * If using Gradle:
        ```bash
        gradle bootRun
        ```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1.  **Register a new user account** or log in with existing credentials.
2.  **Browse products** from the homepage.
3.  **Add items to your cart** and proceed to checkout.

## Learning & Challenges

This project was an invaluable learning experience. Here are some of the key takeaways and challenges encountered:

* **Successfully implemented complex database relationships for products, orders, and users.** This involved designing a robust schema (e.g., using one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in Hibernate/JPA) and ensuring data integrity and efficient querying, which significantly deepened my understanding of relational database design and ORM best practices.
* **Gained hands-on expertise with [Spring Security] to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.** I learned how to configure various security filters, define user roles, and secure REST endpoints, ensuring only authorized users could access specific resources. This was crucial for building a secure e-commerce platform.
* **Made a crucial design decision to prioritize a monolithic architecture over microservices for initial development.** This choice was made to simplify deployment and accelerate the development cycle given the project's scope and my learning objectives as a student. While microservices offer scalability benefits, the monolithic approach allowed me to focus on core functionalities and a faster iteration speed.
